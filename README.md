Cocos2D-X 3.0 Game Development Programming for iOS and Android
==============================================================

Cocos2d-x is an open source cross platform game engine designed to build applications for different platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry and many others. Developers can use C++, JavaScript and Lua to build their applications. The engine has proved to work; at least 25% of the mobile games developed in the world are powered by Cocos2d-x. The main advantage of this engine is that a single source code can be ported to several platforms with little effort.

The goal of this book is to teach you how to build a game using Cocos2d-x. You will learn progressively how to use the different features provided by the engine to put them together in a single application. Using Cocos2d-x by itself is not enough to develop a game; so additional information about the ecosystem that surrounds it is included.
